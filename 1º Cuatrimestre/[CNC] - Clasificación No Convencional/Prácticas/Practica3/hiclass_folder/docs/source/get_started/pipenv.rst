pipenv
======

You will need to install :literal:`pipenv` as follows:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install pipenv

Create a directory for the virtual environment and change to that directory:

.. code-block:: bash

    mkdir hiclass-environment && cd hiclass-environment

Once all the dependencies are installed, to start a session with the correct virtual environment activated:

.. code-block:: bash

    pipenv shell

To exit the shell session:

.. code-block:: bash

    exit
