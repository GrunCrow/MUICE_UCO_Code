        <!--
            Scene of the nature. Made based on models for the background which is a forest and then for
            each of the animals that are in the scene. The birds are flying in the sky, the deer is walking
            and the fish is swimming. The camera is placed in a position where it can see all the animals.

            The scene is animated with the use of the animation property of the a-frame library. The birds
            are moving on the X and Z axis, the deer is moving on the X axis and the fish is moving on the Z
            axis. The camera is static and the light is moving on the X axis.

            The scene is made with the use of the a-frame library and the models have been downloaded. 
            The models are imported in the scene with the use of the gltf-model property of
            the a-frame library. The models are animated with the use of the animation-mixer property of
            the a-frame library.

            This kind of 3D representations can be used for people that want to relax and enjoy the nature,
            but they can't go outside.
